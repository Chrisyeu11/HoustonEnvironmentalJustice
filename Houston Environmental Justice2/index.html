        <p>
            Environmental justice is a social movement that works to protect the earth's ecosystems and address environmental inequalities. Texas Southern University (TSU) is a historically black private university located in Houston, United States, which is involved in various programs and activities related to environmental justice. TSU contributes to researching, supporting, and educating about environmental justice through the following methods:
            Research projects: TSU explores the best practices in emissions control, air and water pollution, and environmental health through academic and laboratory research on environmental justice.
            Courses and education: TSU provides knowledge about environmental justice to students in various disciplines, such as environmental science, urban and regional planning, public administration, and management at undergraduate and graduate levels.
            Collaboration: TSU works with schools, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and community organizations to ensure that environmental justice is integrated into overall development processes.
            Improving environmental sustainability on campus: TSU supports the development and adoption of sustainable strategies and technologies that take into account the three key components of the campus's environmental, economic, and social impacts.
            Universities like TSU are helping to address environmental inequalities in their communities by embracing academic efforts and practicing the principles of environmental justice and sustainability. These efforts are realized through education, research, and collaboration, and serve as a foundation for providing a sustainable environment for future generations.
